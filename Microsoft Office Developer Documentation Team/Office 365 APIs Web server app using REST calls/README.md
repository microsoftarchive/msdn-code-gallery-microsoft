<div><span style="font-size:small">Every day, millions of people use Office 365, the subscription version of the most widely-used productivity platform on the planet. They use Office 365 to collaborate on documents and projects, track contacts, store files,
 and more. It's the hub of their digital lives.</span></div>
<div><br>
<span style="font-size:small">Now, as a developer you can create custom solutions that access and interact with all the richness of your customer's Office 365 data&mdash;and you can build those solutions across all mobile, web, and desktop platforms. The new
 Office 365 APIs enable you to provide access to your customer's Office 365 data, including the things they care about most: their mail, calendars, contacts, users and groups, files, and folders. All right from within your app itself. No matter your development
 platform or tools.</span></div>
<div><br>
<span style="font-size:small">And because the Office 365 APIs offer single sign-on with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can register your app once to access any of the Office 365 API services.</span></div>
<div><br>
<span style="font-size:small">Whether you're building web applications using .NET, PHP, Java, Python, or Ruby on Rails, or creating apps for Windows Universal Apps, iOS, Android, or on another device platform, it's your choice.</span></div>
