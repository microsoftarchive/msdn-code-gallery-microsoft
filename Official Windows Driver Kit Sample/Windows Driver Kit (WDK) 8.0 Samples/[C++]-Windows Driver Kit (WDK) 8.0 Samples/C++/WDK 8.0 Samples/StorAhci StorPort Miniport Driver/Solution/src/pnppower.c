    This function is used to start an AHCI port
It assumes:

Called By:
    HwFindAdapter

Affected Variables/Registers:
    ChannelExtension->StateFlags
    ChannelExtension->CommandList
    ChannelExtension->ReceivedFIS

    PX.CLB,PX.CLBU
    PX.FB,PX.FBU
    CMD.ST
It performs:
    (overview)
    1. Start with some defensive structure checking and variable initialization
    2. Initialize the ChannelConfiguration structure (final steps)
    3. Enable the AHCI interface as per AHCI 1.1 section 10.1.2 (final steps)
    4. Allocate memory for the CommandList, the Receive FIS buffer, and SRB Extension.
    5. Start the channel processing commands.
    (details)
    1.1 Initialize variables
    1.2 Verify the Channel Configuration
    2.1 Initialize the ChannelConfiguration structure
    2.2 Initialize the Channel's base address and the controller's Interrupt Status register address
    3.1 Enable the AHCI interface
        AHCI 1.1 Section 10.1.2 - 5.
        "For each implemented port, system software shall allocate memory for and program:
            •    PxCLB and PxCLBU (if CAP.S64A is set to ‘1’)
            •    PxFB and PxFBU (if CAP.S64A is set to ‘1’)
            It is good practice for system software to ‘zero-out’ the memory allocated and referenced by PxCLB and PxFB.  After setting PxFB and PxFBU to the physical address of the FIS receive area, system software shall set PxCMD.FRE to ‘1’."
    3.2 Enable Interrupts on the Channel
        AHCI 1.1 Section 10.1.2 - 7.
        "Determine which events should cause an interrupt, and set each implemented port’s PxIE register with the appropriate enables."
        Note: Due to the multi-tiered nature of the AHCI HBA’s interrupt architecture, system software must always ensure that the PxIS (clear this first) and IS.IPS (clear this second) registers are cleared to ‘0’ before programming the PxIE and GHC.IE registers. This will prevent any residual bits set in these registers from causing an interrupt to be asserted.

    4.1 Allocate memory for the CommandList, the Receive FIS buffer and SRB Extension
        Now is the time to allocate memory that will be used for controller and per request structures.
        In AHCI, the controller structures are both the command header list and the received FIS buffer.
        The per request structure will be recieved through the SRB and will be used to make a Command Table
        The mechanism for requesting all of this memory is AtaPortGetUnCachedExtension.
        NOTE! AtaPortGetUnCachedExtension can only be called while processing a HwControl IdeStart.
        Also NOTE! In order to perform crashdump/hibernate the UncachedExtensionSize cannot be larger than 30K.

        The call to AtaPortGetUnCachedExtension is complicated by alignment restrictions that an AHCI controller has so here are the rules:
        - Command List Base Addresses must be 1K aligned, and the Command list is (sizeof (AHCI_COMMAND_HEADER) * cap.NCS), which is some multiple of 32 bytes in length.
        - The FIS Base Address must be 256 aligned, and the FIS Receive buffer is sizeof (AHCI_RECEIVED_FIS), 256 bytes in length.
        - The Command Table must be 128 aligned, and is sizeof(AHCI_COMMAND_TABLE), 1280 bytes in length thanks to some padding in the AHCI_COMMAND_TABLE structure.

        The alignment of the addresses (virtual and physical) returned by the function follow these rules
        - the address returned by AtaPortGetUnCachedExtension will have both its virtual and physical addresses page aligned
        - the memory received through the SRB will either be physically and virtually 4K aligned or SRBExtensionSize aligned. The first allocation will be on a 4K boundry the address of the second will be SRBExtensionSize larger than the first, the third will be SRBExtensionSize larger than the second, etc.

        Since the Command Header must be 1K aligned and the uncached extension starts 4K aligned, this works.
        However, the Command Header is variable and must be padded so the Received FIS is on a 256 boundry.
        Therefore the number of Command Headers must be 256/32 = 8. Round cap.NCS to the next multiple of 8
    4.2 Setup the CommandList
        Although the pointer returned from AtaPortGetUnCachedExtension is useful to this driver, it does the controller no good and can't be used in CLB. The VIRTUAL address must be translated into the PHYSICAL address before being written to the CLB register as the controller doesn't have the CPU's virtual address translation tables.  AtaPortGetPhysicalAddress Returns the physical address for the given Va. The va has to be an offset into any one of the following buffers.
            - SRB's data buffer
            - SRB's SrbExtension
            - Miniport's uncached extension
    4.3 Setup the Receive FIS buffer
        Handle the Receive FIS buffer the same as 4.2 Command List
    4.4 Setup the Local SRB Extension
    5.1 Enable Command Processing
    5.2 Initialize the ChannelConfiguration structure
        ChannelConfiguration->ChannelNumber and    ChannelConfiguration->ChannelResources are kept default values.
        If it is found that CI and/or SACT can be changed from a 1 to 0, Number of overlapped requests becomes 1.
        Number of overlapped requests is a 1 based number (1=1, 2=2, etc.), CAP.NCS is a 0 based number.
    5.3 START COMMAND PROCESSING
Return Values:
    The miniport driver returns TRUE if it successfully exectute the whole function.
    Any errors causes the function to return FALSE and prevents the channel from loading. This ultimately causes a yellow '!' to show up on the channel in device manager.

NOTE: as this routine is invoked from FindAdapter where the adapter might not be fully initialized, do not retrieve registry information.
