  DLS Design Overview (DLS Level 1 Specification, MMA)

  A musical instruments defined by a sound sample is much more than a simple wave file.
  In addition to the actual sample data and associated loop information, the instrument
  must indicate under what circumstances each sample should be used, and how to modulate,
  or articulate, the sample as it plays.

  A generic sample-playback synthesis architecture can be broken down into three distinct
  subsystems:

  Control logic

  Digital audio engine

  Articulation modules and connections




  Control Logic

  The control logic receives a MIDI note event and determines which instrument should play
  the note, and, within that instrument, which sample and articulation combination to use.

  Choosing the instrument is little more than observing the MIDI channel number in the
  event and selecting the proper instrument accordingly.

  Choosing the sample and articulation to use is not as simple.  Almost all samples synthesis
  architectures employ some method of organizing samples by note range across the keyboard.
  In addition, multiple samples can be used to represent different velocity randges and
  multiple samples can be played at once to create a layered, richer sound.

  Terms such as layers, splits, blocks, and regions are commonly used in synthesizer jargon
  to refer to the management of multiple samples.  For the purposes here, we refer to them
  as regions.

  DLS Level 1 implements a bare bones approach with no velocity cross-switching and no
  layering.



  Digital Audio Engine

  The digital audio engine is certainly the most obvious part of the synthesizer.  It is
  composed of a playback engine, or digital oscillator, and a digitally controlled amplifier.

  The digital oscillator plays a samples sound waveform, managing loop points within the
  waveform so the sound can play continuously if needed.  And, as the note plays, it responds
  to changes in pitch, allowing for real time expression such as vibrato and pitch bend.

  The digitally controlled amplirier modulates the loudness of the instrument.  Importantly,
  this is used to control the amplitude shape, or envelope, of the note.  However, it is also
  used for other types of real-time expression, such as tremolo.

  Pitch and volume control of the oscillator and amplifier are critical because they define
  the shape of the sounds as it plays, and allow it to be dynamically responsive in real
  time, giving the samples instrument much more expression than the simple digital audio
  playback could ever provide.  Real-time control of these parameters comes from modules in
  the Articulation section which generate a constant stream of changing pitch and volume to
  which the digital audio engine responds.

  The digital audio path represents the journey the sound takes from the oscillator to the
  amplifier to the digital-to-analog converter (DAC).  This patch can optionally include
  additional modules, such as filters and effects devices, that process the sound as it
  flows from oscillator to DAC.

  The DLS Level 1 specificaion implements a simple digital audio engine composed of an
  oscillator, amplifier, and DAC.  The oscillator supports looped as well as one-shot samples.



  Articulation Modules and Connections

  The articulation modules are a set of devices that provide additional control over the
  pitch and volume of the sample as it plays.

  The articulation modules include low frequency oscillators (LFOs) to contribute vibrato
  and tremolo, envelope generators to defint an overall volume and pitch shape to the sample,
  and MIDI real-time controllers, such as Pitch Bend and Mod Wheel, to give the music real-time
  expression.

  Generally, these modules can be linked in different ways to provide different results.  For
  example, a LFO might generate a sine wave which modulates the pitch of the sample for vibrato
  of the volume of the sample for tremolo.  Modules can also receive as well as send control
  signals.  An envelope generator might use the key velocity to influence the attack time of
  the envelope.

  Articulation modules can be configured in different ways, and this configuration is an
  important part of the instrument definition.  In fact, the term patch as used for an
  instrument preset refers to the early days when the hardware modules in an analog
  synthesizer were "patched" together with cables, which routed signals from module to module.

  The ability to configure the modules in important because it yields a flexible approach to
  synthesizer design.  At the same time, it is important to define the base level configuration
  that can be supported by all hardware.

  So, the DLS Level 1 specification is relatively rigid.  It defines a preset routing
  arrangement that is simple enough to be supportable by existing hardware.  Fortunately, it
  is a musically logical and useful configuration.

  Importantly, the specification maps the routing on a flexible system, so it can grow into
  Level 2 and beyond.

  It is important to understand that this is purely a symbolic system that can be mapped on
  many different hardware designs.  Do not think of it as the recipe for a specific method
  for building synthesis architectures.  It should be flexible enough to provide a common
  language between hardware implementations.

 *
 *
 * Essentially, ControlLogic is the big Kahuna that manages
 * the whole system. It parses incoming MIDI events
 * by channel and event type. And, it manages the mixing
 * of voices into the buffer.
 *
 * MIDI Input:
 *
 * The most important events are the note on and
 * off events. When a note on event comes in,
 * ControlLogic searches for an available voice.
 * ControlLogic matches the channel and finds the
 * instrument on that channel. It then call the instrument's
 * ScanForRegion() command which finds the region
 * that matches the note. At this point, it can copy
 * the region and associated articulation into the
 * voice, using the StartVoice command.
 *
 * When it receives the sustain pedal command,
 * it artificially sets all notes on the channel on
 * until a sustain off arrives. To keep track of notes
 * that have been shut off while the sustain was on
 * it uses an array of 128 shorts, with each bit position
 * representing a channel. When the sustain releases,
 * it scans through the array and creates a note off for
 * each bit that was set.
 *
 * Additional continuous controller events are managed
 * by the CModWheelIn, CPitchBendIn, etc., MIDI input recording
 * modules.
 *
 * Mixing:
 *
 * Control Logic is also called to mix the instruments into a buffer
 * at regular intervals. The buffer is provided by the calling sound
 * driver. Each voice is called to mix its sample into the buffer.
