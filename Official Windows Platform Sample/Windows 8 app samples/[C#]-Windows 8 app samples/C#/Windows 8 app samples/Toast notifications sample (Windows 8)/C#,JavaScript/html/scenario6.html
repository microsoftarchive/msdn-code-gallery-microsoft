        <p>In this scenario, the app will raise toasts which stay on screen longer than the default toast duration.</p>
        <p>Long-duration toasts stay on the screen longer than standard toasts. They are useful for incoming 
            phone calls and alarms. For these toasts, accompanying audio can be either 
            looped or played only once. Long-duration toasts time out after 25 seconds, while normal toasts decay 
            after only a few seconds.</p>
        <button id="loopingButton" class="action">Display a long toast with looping audio</button>
        <button id="noLoopingButton" class="action">Display a long toast without looping audio</button>
        <button id="hideToastButton" class="action secondary">Hide last toast from Scenario 6</button>
        <br /><br />
        Since notifications are just XML, you can create them in many different ways. Above, 
        the NotificationsExtensions library is used. You can also create notifications with strings:
        <br />
        <button class="action" id="loopingButtonString">Display a long toast with looping audio with strings</button>
        <button class="action" id="noLoopingButtonString">Display a long toast without looping audio with strings</button>
    </div>
    <div data-win-control="SdkSample.ScenarioOutput">
        <p>When you create a toast, the XML will appear here</p>
    </div>
