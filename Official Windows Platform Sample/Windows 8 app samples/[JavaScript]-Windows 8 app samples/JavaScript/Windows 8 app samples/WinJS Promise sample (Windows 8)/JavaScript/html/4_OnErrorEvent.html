            Exceptions generated during asynchronous operations are delivered
            to user code to the optional error handler defined in the then()
            method. Note, there are a class of errors in JavaScript (for
            example, referencing an undefined variable or method) delivered
            as exceptions, but aren't something a developer would want to
            actually put in an error handler for such as syntax errors.
            <br />
            The Promise.onerror event is raised whenever an exception or
            error caught inside a promise, regardless of the presence of an
            actual error handler or not. This provides a central point where
            a developer can do logging or put a breakpoint and catch
            exceptions that would otherwise have been silently handled by the
            Promise object.
