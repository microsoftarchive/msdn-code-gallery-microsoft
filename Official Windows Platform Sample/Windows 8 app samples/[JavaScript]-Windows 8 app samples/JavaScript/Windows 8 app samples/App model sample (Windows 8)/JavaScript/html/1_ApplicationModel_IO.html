             <p>The WinRT provides applications three buckets to store unstructured state (files), a local container which is unique to a single user on a single machine inside of a single application; a roaming container which is unique to a single user from a single application but roams across multiple machines; and a temporary container which has the same limitations as the local container, but may be automatically be purged by the system,.
             These APIs provide rich access to the full WinRT IO functionality, creating sub directories, multiple file formats, and full async programming at multiple layers. For applications that are storing significant data in their local or roaming container, we would definitely recommend to use the base WinRT APIs.
