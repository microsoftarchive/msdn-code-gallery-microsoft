        <p>This scenario will create secondary tiles that are capable of appearing on the lock screen. Two different 
           secondary tiles will be created, one which can only show a badge on the lock screen and one which can show 
           both a badge and tile text on the lock screen.</p>
        <p>In order to create a secondary tile that is capable of showing notifications on the lock screen, the app 
           must first declare itself to be capable of appearing on the lock screen, as discussed in Scenario 1. However, 
           the app's main tile does not need to be on the lock screen for its secondary tiles to be placed on the lock 
           screen. To create a secondary tile which is capable of appearing on the lock screen, the lockScreenBadgeLogo 
           property for the secondary tile must be set. Setting this property flags the secondary tile as being capable
           of displaying a badge on the lock screen.  Setting the optional lockScreenDisplayBadgeAndTileText property 
           flags the secondary tile as capable of displaying its tile text on the lock screen.
        <p>Once those properties are set, the secondary tile can be created.  As long as the secondary tile is on a user's 
           Start screen, it will appear in the list of allowable lock screen apps on the Lock screen tab of the 
           Personalization page.</p>
        <p>See the Secondary Tiles SDK sample for more information on creating and pinning secondary tiles.</p>
