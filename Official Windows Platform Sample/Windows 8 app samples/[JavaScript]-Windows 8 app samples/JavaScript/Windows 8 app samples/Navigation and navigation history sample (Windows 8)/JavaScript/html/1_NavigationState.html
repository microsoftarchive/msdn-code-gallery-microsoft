            The WinJS.Navigation namespace provides a data structure that
            tracks navigation from page to page, without actually navigating
            the browser. The navigation stack provides events and properties
            for tracking the current "position" in the navigation, and if you
            can navigate forward or backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            This scenario demonstrates the features that let you check the
            current state of the navigation stack, as well as the simple
            "goBack" and "goForward" methods. The scenario selection dropdown
            also uses navigation to change scenarios, so navigate back to
            this page later to see how the navigation state has changed.
