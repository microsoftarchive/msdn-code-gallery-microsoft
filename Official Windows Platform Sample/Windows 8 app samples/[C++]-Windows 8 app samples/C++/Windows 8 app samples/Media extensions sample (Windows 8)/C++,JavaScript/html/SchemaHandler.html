            A Scheme handler allows an application to source a media stream to the playback
            engine. In this example, the video frames are created by the scheme handler on the
            fly. It can produce flying balls, squares, or rectangles each determined by the
            scheme type passed down from the application. Scheme handlers are usefull for situations
            where the source of the media is not a file.</p>
