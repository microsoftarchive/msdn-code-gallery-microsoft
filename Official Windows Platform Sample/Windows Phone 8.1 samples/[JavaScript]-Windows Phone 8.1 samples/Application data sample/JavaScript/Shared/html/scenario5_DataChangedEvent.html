            For roaming of settings or files, the app needs to know when data has changed to update its UI accordingly.  The datachanged event will be invoked anytime a sync from the roaming handler occurs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This scenario will respond to the datachanged event and update the UI.  Run this scenario on two machines logged in with the same Microsoft Account to see the UI change as the updated setting is roamed down.
