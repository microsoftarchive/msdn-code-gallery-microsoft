            Applications are automatically set to the most appropriate language(s) supported
            by the app and preferred by the user. The application does not have to call any
            APIs. Resources, fonts and DOM properties are all set using this application-specific
            language(s). Applications can retrieve their current language(s) if necessary for
            communication with other systems through the ResourceContext object.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some applications may also want to be able to specifically set their application
            language(s) to something other than the one(s) based on the user’s preferred language.
            Applications can make a call to change their application language persistently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note, application language settings UI is best exposed within the Settings charm
            and not directly on the app canvas.
