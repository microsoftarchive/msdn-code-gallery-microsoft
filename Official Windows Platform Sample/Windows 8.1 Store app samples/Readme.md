<span style="color:#0000ff">Windows on GitHub</span></a>.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This sample pack includes all the app code examples developed and updated for Windows&nbsp;8.1, including app code examples created using any of the universal app templates available in Visual Studio. Each solution of a universal app code example is structured
 so the code example can run on both Windows&nbsp;8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. For more info about how to build apps that target Windows and Windows Phone with Visual Studio, see Build apps that target Windows and Windows Phone 8.1 by using Visual Studio. The
 sample pack provides a convenient way to download all the samples at once. The samples in this sample pack are available in C#, C&#43;&#43;, and JavaScript. The Windows Samples Gallery contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various new programming models,
 platforms, features, and components available in Windows&nbsp;8.1 and/or Windows Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2. These downloadable samples are provided as compressed ZIP files that contain a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for the sample, along with the source
 files, assets, resources, and metadata necessary to successfully compile and run the sample.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;These samples require Windows&nbsp;8.1 and Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2013. The samples created using any of the universal app templates require that you update your Visual Studio&nbsp;2013 installation with
 Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2013 Update&nbsp;2 or later. All of these samples can compile in Visual Studio&nbsp;2013 with Visual Studio&nbsp;2013 Update&nbsp;2 or later, but the samples created using any of the universal app templates require Visual Studio&nbsp;2013
 Update&nbsp;2 or later. These samples don't compile in Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2012 for Windows&nbsp;8.</p>
