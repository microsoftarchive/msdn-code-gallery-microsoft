        In this scenario, the app will update and clear badge and tile notifications on the lock screen.
      <br />
        <br />
        Lock screen apps can display up-to-date information through badge notifications and tile updates. Badge 
      notifications are limited to an integer or glyph that is displayed next to a monochrome badge associated 
      with the app. The badge displayed on the lock screen is the same badge that is displayed on the app's Start tile. 
      Tile updates are sent in the same manner as updates sent to the tile on the Start screen, but are limited to text 
      only and must be wide templates. The most recent wide tile update for the app will be displayed on the lock screen. 
      If an image-only template or the default tile is set, then nothing will appear for the app in the detailed status 
      slot on the lock screen. Users must manually select which app may show tile notifications on the lock screen. 
      Please see the "Tiles" and "Push and Periodic Notifications" samples for more information on how an app can display 
      update tile notifications. 
        <button id="scenario2SendBadge" class="action">

        <button id="scenario2ClearBadge" class="action">
            Clear badge notification</button>
        <br />
        <br />
        <button id="scenario2SendTile" class="action">

        <button id="scenario2ClearTile" class="action">
            Clear tile notification</button>
        <br />
        <br />
        Above, the NotificationsExtensions library is used to create notifications. You can also create notifications with strings:
        <br />
        <button id="scenario2SendBadgeString" class="action">
            Send badge notification</button>
        <button id="scenario2SendTileString" class="action">
            Send tile notification</button>
        <br />
