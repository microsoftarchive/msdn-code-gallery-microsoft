                            div elements, where each div element is associated with a text entry being echoed. By 
                            using the aria-live "assertive" and aria-relevant "additions" properties here, whenever 
                            an element gets added beneath the chatTextContainer element, assistive technologies will 
                            be notified that the user is to be made aware of the new element immediately. By default, 
                            the chatTextContainer element gets an aria-atomic value of "false", which specifies that 
                            only data from the added element should be presented by the assistive technology, rather 
                            than the entire contents of the chatTextEchoContainer element. -->
                    <!-- *** Note that in practice, "assertive" live regions should be used only with care. If
                            a live region is marked as "assertive" and it gets updated frequently, then the result
                            could be that the user constantly gets interrupted with the updates, and this interferes
                            with other tasks that they're performing. In order to prevent these interruptions, often 
                            live regions will be marked as "polite" rather than "assertive". The user will be notified 
                            of updates to "polite" regions, but these notifications will not interrupt what the user's 
                            currently doing. -->
                    <!-- By default, an element with a role of "log" is considered to have an aria-live value of "polite". -->
