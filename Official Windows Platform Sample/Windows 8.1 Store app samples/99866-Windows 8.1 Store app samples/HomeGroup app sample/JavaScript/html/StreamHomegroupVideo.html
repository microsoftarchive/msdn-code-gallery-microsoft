            Video, audio, and image streaming has been built into the WinRT API's so that users don't have to wait for a large file to completely load before consuming the content. The "PlayTo" SDK sample has more information on streaming and managing media over networks. This scenario shows the simple case of picking a video on the homegroup, and streaming it to a video tag.
