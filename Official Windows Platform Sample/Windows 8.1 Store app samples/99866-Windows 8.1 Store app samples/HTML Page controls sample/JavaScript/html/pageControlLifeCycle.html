        <p>Page controls typically only need to implement a single method, ready, to do initialization. However,
            for those controls with more advanced needs, there are a series of methods that can be overridden
            to customize the control creation and rendering. The control here demonstrates each of these methods.
            Look at /pages/advancedControl.js for details.
