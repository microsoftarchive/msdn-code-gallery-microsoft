        <p>Developers will learn how to combine adaptive CSS layout techniques with other application technologies. This sample demonstrates the critical concepts by providing an implementation of an application. Specifically, the sample utilizes CSS Grid, Media Queries, and ListView to create a fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes and view states. </p>
        <p>Explore how this works by resizing the app, and examining how the flexible regions of the grid change. Also see how the layout of the application changes significantly, when app is in portrait orientation (height is greater than width), or when width is less than 500px: regions of the application are reordered, or elminiated entirely, depending on the available space.</p>
