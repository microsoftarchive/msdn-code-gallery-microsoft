## Description

<div id="mainSection">
<p>This sample shows how to make an XML document writer app using XmlLite. The XmlLite library allows developers to build high-performance XML-based applications that provide a high degree of interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0
 standard. The primary goals of XmlLite are ease of use, performance, and standards compliance. XmlLite works with any Windows language that can use dynamic link libraries (DLLs), but Microsoft recommends C&#43;&#43;. XmlLite comes with all necessary support files
 for use with C&#43;&#43;, but if you want to use it with other languages, some additional work may be required.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Windows Samples Gallery contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various new programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows&nbsp;8.1 and/or Windows Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2. These downloadable samples
 are provided as compressed ZIP files that contain a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for the sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata necessary to successfully compile and run the sample. For more information about the programming
 models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in this sample, please refer to the guidance, tutorials, and reference topics provided in the Windows&nbsp;8.1 documentation available in the Windows Developer Center. This sample is provided as-is in order to
 indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows&nbsp;8.1 and/or Windows Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2. Please provide feedback on this sample!</p>
