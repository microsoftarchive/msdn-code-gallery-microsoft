<p>LINQ to Xml Data Binding sample shows data binding in WPF using Linq To Xml.&nbsp; 
    The example allows you to stream videos from Soapbox on MSN Videos and lets you 
    keep a list of your favorties(MyFavorties).&nbsp; The interface has two tabs, &quot;Soapbox on 
    MSN Video&quot;, and &quot;Edit MyFavorites&quot;.&nbsp; Soapbox on MSN Video allows you to browse 
    through predefined video lists as well as your custom search results.&nbsp; If you happen to 
    like a video you can add it to MyFavorites by clicking on the Add button.&nbsp; In 
    Edit MyFavorties you can update the video description as well as delete a video 
    from MyFavorites.&nbsp; Look at Window1.xaml file to see how controls are bound 
    to streaming XML data.</p>


<p>Many of the LINQ samples, including LINQ to Northwind, require the Northwind 
sample database that is located in the Data directory. By default the Data 
directory will be located under the same parent folder as the other LINQ 
samples. This will ensure that the path for the database files will be 
resolved automatically. Many of the sample files also require the <strong>
ObjectDumper</strong> project.</p>
