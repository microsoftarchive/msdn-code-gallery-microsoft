<p>This is a library used by some of the other LINQ samples.</p>

<p>The NorthwindMapping.DBML file in this project generates the custom CLR 
classes used to access the underlying SQL Server database.&nbsp; By changing the 
properties in the designer for NorthwindMapping.DBML, you can modify the classes 
that are generated and ensure that you have the exact datatypes and object 
relationships that you want.&nbsp; You can see the resulting classes by looking 
at the generated code-behind file, NorthwindMapping.designer.cs.</p>
