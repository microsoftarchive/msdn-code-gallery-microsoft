This sample of a Visual WebPart demonstrates how to list all of the site collections on the local SharePoint server.  For the selected site collection it displays statistical data for each list within the site collection.

To run the sample

 - Change the Site URL property of the project to a valid SharePoint site on your development machine (i.e. http://<MachineName>)

When you run (F5) the sample a browser window will be opened to the home page of your development site.  From the Stie Actions menu choose "More Options..." and then create a Web Part Page.  After naming and creating the page, add the web part onto it.
